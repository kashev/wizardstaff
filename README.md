## About
In our submission for HackIllinois Hardware 2015, we decided to modernize a classic drinking game "Wisest Wizard" (also known as "Wizard Staffs"). For the unfamiliar, the game involves drinking from cans of beer, and upon finishing a can, opening a new one and stacking it atop the previous one, securing it down with duct tape. The fallback to this is that the game is only playable with cheaper beer, so beer that comes in a glass doesn't quite work with this set up. 

Our hack consists of adding DIY moisture sensors with Spark microcontrollers to pint glasses. When the glass is detected as empty, it pings the Android app and informs it that a drink has been completed. The app contains of chart printout of all contestants and their current "wizard level", which is stored in a <company name here> database.
