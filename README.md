## About

[Wizard Staff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_Staff) is a popular drinking game in which one tapes consecutive new cans of liquid on top of their empties, and thereby creates a "Wizard's Staff". If one's staff is longer than another player, then that higher level wizard may instruct the lower level wizard to hydrate himself.

But what if your liquid of choice doesn't come in cans?

Enter [**wizard staff**](https://github.com/kashev/wizardstaff). **wizard staff** is a set of connected pint glasses, an Android app, and companion Pebble app. It allows for people to play Wizard Staff with any liquid that goes in a glass. Stay hydrated!
